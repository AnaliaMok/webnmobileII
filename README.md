<h1>Web and Mobile II Website</h1>
<p>
    This project contains a homepage and all of the exercise files for my Web and Mobile II class.
    All assignments - with the exception of exercise two - allowed students to choose their own
    style theme.
</p>

<h3>How to View</h3>
<p>
    This project is currently hosted on Rochester Institute of Technology's web servers - which cannot be connected to
    unless the requesting device is on an RIT Internet connection: which is why this project is placed on my GitHub account. The website is self-contained: opening any of the HTML files in any browser should lead to a complete view of
    the page.
</p>

<h3>Future Additions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Individual &amp; Group projects</li>
    <li>Exercises including Javascript and PHP</li>
    <li>The navigation buttons for exercises will be placed into a hidden list that will only be 
     displayed once an "Exercise" button is hovered over.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Changes</h3>
<p>Currently, the images found in project one are not compressed properly for fast mobile viewing.</p>
<p>The project1 folder may not be clickable, so a self-contained zip folder is available for any of your viewing needs. NOTE: Given that the images are not compressed, the zip folder could not be uploaded with the images. Opening project1's index page will result in you not seeing the nice images or image animations.</p>
