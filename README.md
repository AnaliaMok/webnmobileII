<h1>Web and Mobile II Website</h1>
<p>
    This project contains a homepage and all of the exercise files for my Web and Mobile II class.
    All assignments - with the exception of exercise two - allowed students to choose their own
    style theme.
</p>

<h3>How to View</h3>
<p>
    This project is currently hosted on Rochester Institute of Technology's web servers - which cannot be connected to=
    unless the requesting device is on an RIT Internet connection: which is why this projected is placed into my GitHub 
    page. The website is self-contained: opening any of the HTML files in any browser should lead to a complete view of
    the page.

<h3>Future Additions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Individual &amp; Group projects</li>
    <li>Exercises including Javascript and PHP</li>
    <li>The navigation buttons for exercises will be placed into a hidden list that will only be 
     displayed once an "Exercise" button is hovered over.</li>
</ul>
