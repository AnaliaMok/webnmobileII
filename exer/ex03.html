            <p class="def_content">The user navigation - as entailed by the name - is meant to be easily usable for
                any end user: in other words, it should be easily usable and should clearly
                show users how to get to the information they need. For example, the navigation below allows
                users of various OpenGL experience to immediately go to the sections they need.</p>

            <h2>What is a Site Map?</h2>
            <p class="def_content">Unlike a user navigation, a site map has a full listing of the URLs associated with a whole
                website. It is a tool used by a website creator to tell a "search engine how to crawl his page" ("What" 2008)
                :more specifically, what pages not too look at or what keywords to look for. Each URL is associated with
                some set of metadata that a creator can either manipulate - as mentioned before - or to view. 
                Metadata includes "latest update time, how often a URL [and its contents] change" ("What" 2008) and more: all
                of which can be used by a search engine's web crawlers.

            <div id="sitemap_holder">

            <h2>What Are the Differences?</h2>
            <div id="differences_content">
                <p>At first glance, the sitemap directory structure looks very similar to that of the actual
                    user navigation; however, this can only be said for most of the second directory level. There
                    are two main directories that are either inaccessible by the user or are accessible - yet are 
                    not part of the user navigation: an "assets" and an "uncategorized directory."
                </p>
                <p>Immediately, we can see that there is an "assets/faq_quaternions" directory that is inaccessible from the
                    actual site. If one were to click the link in this directory, it will lead to a plain 
                    html document - created in March 2002 - containing a list of contributions to the page
                    and information about matrices, quaternions, and graphics programming using both structures.
                    It is odd that information such as this is excluded from a tutorial site about graphics
                    programing - yet is still accessible through the sitemap. Given the date of the last update,
                    it can be assumed that the creator(s) of this site do not want to display outdated information
                    yet still want to keep the page for archival reasons.
                </p>
                <p>In terms of the "uncategorized" directory, all the pages listed are accessible. The links are
                    just listed in the lower half of the homepage under a "News" section. For the sake of an "update"
                    section for users and a changelog for the creators, it is understandable as to why these links
                    are not part of the user navigation. Plus, each link is buried in a directory structure that is
                    obviously meant for archival purposes: the directories are named after years and possibly version
                    numbers. These links also emphasize the difference between a sitemap and a user navigation: a 
                    sitemap is meant for all urls of the entire website while the user navigation is meant just for 
                    easy accessibility for the user. The user does not need access to all information in a given site.
                </p>
                <p>Overall, the sitemap for this tutorial site is not too different from the actual user navigation - despite
                    the two main "hidden" directories. All pages accessible by the user navigation are shown on the sitemap; 
                    granted, the links in the sitemap are in alphabetical order - which is mostly for the sake of the web crawler.
                    Comparing the two, though, does show the obvious differences and reasons of what is and what is not shown
                    to the user.
